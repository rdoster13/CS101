I first attempted to use strategy 1: sticking with my original choice after Monty revealed the goat. 
Using this technique, I picked door 1 each time and I won 9 of the 20 games with a win percentage of 45.00%.

I then attempted to use technique 2: switching my door choice after the reveal.
Using this strategy, i started with door one each time, 
then switched to the other choice that wasn't Monty's reveal.
THis strategy yielded 17 of 20 games won with a win percentage of 80.95%.

In the end the second strategy yielded far greater results in winning. 
I won 17 games, compared to 9 using the first strategy.
My win percentage was 80.95% compared to the 45.00% with the first strategy.
